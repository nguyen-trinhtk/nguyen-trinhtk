<h3 align="center"><code>Hi there, I'm Nguyen 🫘</code></h3>

  `✌️` I'm a second-year `Computer Science` student at Drexel University 

  `💻` I'm interested in `full-stack development`, `computer vision`, and `applied linear algebra`

  `☕` Hang on, I’m currently brewing [`NeoPAL`](https://github.com/nguyen-trinhtk/NeoPAL)...

  `🌱` In the meantime, check out [`my portfolio`](ngtr.me)!

  `📄` What have I been doing? View my [`CV`](https://ngtr.me/cv.html).

  `🥥` Boring fact of the day: `A coconut can't draw, but a nerd can.`
