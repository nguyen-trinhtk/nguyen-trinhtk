<h3 align="center">Hi there, I'm Nguyen 🫘</h3>

✌️ I'm a second-year Computer Science student at Drexel University 

💻 I'm interested in `full-stack development`, `computer vision`, and `applied linear algebra` (and casually `embedded systems`) 

☕ Hang on, I’m currently brewing [NeoPAL](https://github.com/nguyen-trinhtk/NeoPAL)...

🌱 In the meantime, check out [my portfolio](ngtr.me)!

📄 What have I been doing? View my [CV](https://ngtr.me/cv.html).

🥥 Boring fact of the day: `A coconut can't draw, but a nerd can :)`
