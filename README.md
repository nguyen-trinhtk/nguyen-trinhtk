<h3 align="center"><code>Hi there, I'm Nguyen 🫘</code></h3>

  `✌️` I'm a second-year `Computer Science` student at Drexel University. \
  `💻` I'm interested in `full-stack dev`, `computer vision`, and `applied linear algebra`. \
  `🫖` Hang on, I’m currently brewing [`NeoPAL`](https://github.com/nguyen-trinhtk/NeoPAL)... \
  `🌱` In the meantime, check out [`my portfolio`](ngtr.me)! \
  `📄` What have I been doing? View my [`CV`](https://ngtr.me/cv.html). \
  `🥥` Boring fact of the day: `A coconut can't draw, but a nerd can.`
